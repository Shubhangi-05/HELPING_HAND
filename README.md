# HELPING_HAND

This is a full stack web project which I have developed using The MERN stack 
The aim of this project is to help the poor people, children, women and the elderly people in availing their basic needs , for example , food, clothing , health , education related to women empowerment, oldage care.

# Featues include:
Local people and the NGOs can register themselves .
JWT Authorization.
Users can create a post indicating the region and the help needed by the people there.
Other users and NGOs can view the posts and can help via visiting the location.
Local people can also donate money to any of the NGOs.

# Objective:
This web application provides a platform so that the local people as well as the NGOs are connected at one place
and work together as a team in making our society a better place to live 
NGOs play a significant role in helping people through their initiatives to provide food, clothing, educate people about their rights and sometimes also take help from the government.
This application thus can help NGOs too in getting funds , as well as if any user wants to donate clothes, food to a particular NGO , NGOs can contact to the users.
